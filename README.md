## Setup 🔨

In order to use the application inside this repository you just have to install `Python > 3.7` with the below dependencies:

| Language      | Library Name  | Version                   |
| ------------- |:-------------:|:-------------------------:|
| Python        | Eel           | 0.14.0                    |
| Python        | Pycryptodome  | 3.10.1                    |

After installing those dependencies you can simply open the `.exe` file if you use `windows` or run this command on your prompt:

```bash
../SubVault>python __main__.py
```

You can now play around with SubVault.

## About 

As the description of the project says, this repository is all about privacy. More specifically you can find a GUI folder encryption application made with the help of:
- `Python`
- `Electron`
- `html/css`
- `tailwind/css`

More details about the above thechnologies you can find in the [Technologies](#technologies) section.

## How To Use

The app is pretty is to use. After you install all the necessary packages open the app as mentioned in the [Setup](#setup) section.
So, there are three steps to start using this app,

1. Give the name of the folder you want to encrypt
2. Set a password for encryption algorithm. (A new file with the `.vl` extention should appear inside the folder you opened the app)
3. Select Unencrypt and type the password you just set.

There is an extra option to show the log of the folder. (The date and time when it was decrypted) you can find that option in the window of decryption of the folder.

## Conlusion ✨

Pretty fun project to make. Always wanted to make something like this since I was younger. Also I learnt a lot of new technologies, for instance (tailwind/css..).
